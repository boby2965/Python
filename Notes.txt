Day 1  -- Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data
==========================================================

print()   --> Used to print output to the console
input()   --> Takes input from the console
               - The Data given to  the input function will always be a "String"
Ex:
  print("hello world")  --> Prints the output as hello world in the console.
            Here hello world in the paranthesis is called as "String"

  - To comment a line we use "#"
  - By using ctrl + / comments an already existing line of code
      Note:
        - we can nest the input in the print function as follows
            print("Hello"+ input("Your name please!"))
      
        - When printing the output we should be careful about the spaces/ Indentation before the print function 
          If there is an extra space before the print function then it will throw an "Indentation Error".

String:
-------
    - String should always start and end with Double/Single quotes.
    - By using an "+" operator we can concatinate the strings
      ex:
        print("Hello" + "World")   --> It prints HelloWorld as output
Note:
  If the quotations are missing then it will throw an "syntax Error".

Variables:
---------- 
  - We store the data in a variable.
  - We use Camel casing for variable naming in python
  - spaces should not be used between the words oa a variable.
  - We use "_" to seperate words in python.
  - we cant use number at the begining of the variable.
  - We should not use keywords as variables.
Ex:
    name = input("What is your name")
    print("name")

Day2 -- Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings
=================================================
Data Types:
-----------
- String
- Integer
- Float 
- Boolean

String:
-------
  print("hello"[0])      --> gives 'h' as output
  print("123"[1])        --> gives '2' as output
      - This method of pulling out a particular element from a string is called "sub-scripting/ subscript".
      - The starting number always starts from "0".
Note:
      - we cannot concatinate string with integer as it will throw an error.
                num= len(input("what is your name"))
                print("your name has"+ num +"characters")    --> this code will throw an error
      - To change a integer into string we use 
                str(num)    
      - If a number 1.65 is given as an input then it can only be converted to "float" and not into an integer.
                  num= input("given number")
                  float(num)
Integer:
--------
  print(123 + 345)   --> gives output as '468'
  print(123_456_879)  --> gives output as '123456879'

Float:
-------
  print(3.14)  
 

Boolean:
--------
  True (or) False

Mathematical Operators:
-----------------------
      +  --> addition
      -  --> Subtraction
      *  --> Multiplication
      /  --> Division -- always gives float
      ** --> Exponent
  - Python follows PEMDAS rules
      p - paranthesis  
      e - exponent
      m  - multiplication  d  - Division
      A   - Addition       S - Subtraction
- The calculation which is to the left has the most priority.

f-string:
----------
- In-order to decreace the use of string fomatiing in the print function we can use f-string.
      score = 2
      height = 1.56
      isWinning = True
      #print("Your score is" + str(score)+" ...")    -- Instead of this line of code we can use
      print(f"Your score is {score} ...)

Day3 -- Control flow and Logical operators
============================================
If/ Else Conditional:
---------------------
if condition:
  do this
else: 
  do this

Nested If/else:
--------------
if condition:
  if another condition:
    do this
  else:
    do this
else: 
  do this

If/ Elif/Else:
---------------
if condition1:
  do A
elif condition2:
  do B
else: 
  do this

Multiple If's:
--------------
if condition1:
  do A
if condition2:
  do B
if condition3:
  do C

Logical Operators:
------------------
A and B    --> Both of htem needs to be true
C or D     --> Either of them is true
not E      --> If the condition is true then it becomes false

Day4 --
