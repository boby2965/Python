Day 1  -- Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data
==========================================================

print()   --> Used to print output to the console
input()   --> Takes input from the console
Ex:
  print("hello world")  --> Prints the output as hello world in the console.
            Here hello world in the paranthesis is called as "String"

- To comment a line we use "#"
- By using ctrl + / comments an already existing line of code
Note:
  - we can nest the input in the print function as follows
  Ex:
      print("Hello"+ input("Your name please!"))

  - When printing the output we should be careful about the spaces/ Indentation before the print function 
    If there is an extra space before the print function then it will throw an "Indentation Error".

String:
-------
    - String should always start and end with Double/Single quotes.
    - By using an "+" operator we can concatinate the strings
      ex:
        print("Hello" + "World")   --> It prints HelloWorld as output
Note:
  If the quotations are missing then it will throw an "syntax Error".

Variables:
---------- 
  - We store the data in a variable.
  - We use Camel casing for variable naming in python
  - spaces should not be used between the words oa a variable.
  - We use "_" to seperate words in python.
  - we cant use number at the begining of the variable.
  - We should not use keywords as variables.
Ex:
    name = input("What is your name")
    print("name")

Day2 -- Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings
=================================================
Data Types:
-----------
- String
- Integer
- Float 
- Boolean

String:
-------
  print("hello"[0])      --> gives 'h' as output
  print("123"[1])        --> gives '2' as output
      - This method of pulling out a particular element from a string is called "sub-scripting/ subscript".
      - The starting number always starts from "0".
Note:
  we cannot concatinate string with integer as it will throw an error.
  Ex:
    num= len(input("what is your name"))
    print("your name has"+ num +"characters")    --> this code will throw an error

Integer:
--------
  print(123 + 345)   --> gives output as '468'
  print(123_456_879)  --> gives output as '123456879'

Float:
-------
  print(3.14)    

Boolean:
--------
  True (or) False
